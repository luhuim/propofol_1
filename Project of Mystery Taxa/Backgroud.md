### Mystery	Taxa
You	will	be	facing	the	challenge	with	an	unknown	VCF-file	where	you	are	supposed	to	find	out	how	the	different	taxa	are	related.   
In	the	project information	page	the name	and	location	of	the	vcf-file	is	specified.  
The	important	thing	is	to	gain	an	understanding	of	how	you	can	examine	the	VCF-file	to	gain	biological	insights. 

**First**,	you	will	need	to	find	out	what	a	VCF-file	(Variant	Calling	Format,	with	the	extention	.vcf) is.  
**Then**,	find	out	how	to	check	the	names	of	individuals	within	a	VCF-file.	What	groups	do	you	think	are	found	in	the	file	based	on	this? Find	out	how	to	check	the	number	of	chromosomes.

**Question**
What	are	the	multivariate	relationships	between	the	taxa?	Use	a	principal	component	analysis that	decomposes	data	of	high	dimensionality.
